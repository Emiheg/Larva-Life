# Larva-Life
Solo gamejam : Theme: Tiny world. 
You play as a larva in a tiny world that loops around. You choose the width and height of the world to live in and have the ability to pick up and move blocks to transform the world to your choosing. With the ability to wall climb (and even stick to the roof) you can create a world that best fits the life of a larva. 

#Further development
1. Loop-racing
As showcased in the video "Looptrack" I found the possibility of forming the world to quickly and effectively move through the world to be quite entertaining and satisfying. In the video it is showcased how wall and roof climbing opens up unique pathways, and by adding only one single block to it can completely transform how you move through the world. By creating a loop-racing element to the game with a public high-score ladder would give the game a challenge while also motivating and rewarding creative thinking. The player then needs to weigh up just powering through the already set loop, or take some time to transform it and effectivise it (optimally combining these two strategies, forming the loop as you run through it). 

2. Add new movement and abilities
- Airdash
Building on the racing idea I think it would be great to give the player more movement to open up new creative ways of moving through the loop.
Now the larva instantly changes movement directions with no delay or change in velocity, even when airborne. To give an interactive movement ability to the larva it should contrast this standard movement in some ways, with its own pros and cons. An airborne sidedash would be a great new tool for the player, giving a slight speedboost and goes into sliding mode opening up the possibility to slide through 1 block openings. To balance this we make the player lock into one direction while airborne and also lose the ability to wall climb while sliding. By adding a speedboost we add a timing and knowledge skill to the game, rewarding players to use this movement in the right conditions. When landing while sliding is the only time the player can change direction during the slide, adding some control to the sliding mechanism. (This makes it possible for the player to move through a 'Z' or '2' formation: jumping to the right, airdashing to the left and slide-landing to the right)
- Store multiple blocks and upgraded abilities
Adding a storage of, say, 3 blocks and have abilities that can use this as ammo to enhance their effect. 
- Pillar-jump
Use up to 3 blocks to create a pillar under you that catapults you up into the air
- Airdash-Turbo
Create a platform behind you as you shoot to the side, destroying walls as you hit them


3. New blocks and timing based elements
New blocks: slowing, speed, bounce and even-odd time based effects
Rising water during the loop.
Moving platforms.
